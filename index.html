                <h3>Chicken Cutlets with Sun-Dried Tomato Cream Sauce</h3>
                <p>Though a chicken cutlet may be a chicken breast cut in half, this recipe shows how to make chicken cutlets with double the deliciousness. A jar of sun-dried tomatoes does double duty for this healthy dinner recipe. The flavorful oil they're packed in is used to saut√© the chicken, and the tomatoes go into the cream sauce.</p>

                <h3>Sweet Potato & Black Bean Chili</h3>
                <p>Make a double batch of this quick vegetarian chili, full of black beans and sweet potatoes, and eat it for lunch the next day or freeze the extras for another night. We love the smoky heat from the ground chipotle, but omit it if you prefer a mild chili. Serve with tortilla chips or cornbread and coleslaw.</p>
