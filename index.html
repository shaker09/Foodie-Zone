            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h4>Living healthy have always been my passion. I love it, and I love to share good food and nutrition info with others! I have changed my health and the health of my family just by the foods we eat</h4>
            <p>
                I earned a diploma in Nutrition from Ashworth University, have taken holistic nutrition classes from Clayton College, earned my certification as a health coach from the Integrative Institute of Nutrition and now my certification as Cooking Instructor with Healthy Hands Cooking.  I also have studied with Christina Pirello of Christina Cooks fame! Additionally, I hold a B.A. in Journalism/Advertising from Temple University.
